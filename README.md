# LAN-PARTY

This project as for goal to help share file between computer on a lan party.
We used to share file with smb  on a computer or on a NAS, whith people increasing this method became too slow because of the NAS or computer network card, end up being saturated.
Here we have a solution to share file between people with a local torrent tracker and an httpseed for initial transfert, no DHT, Pex, or LSD so the internet connexion is not used.

The project is at very early stage of development, it as no security feature implented, and it is still missing some feature.
