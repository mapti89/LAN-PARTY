# LAN-PARTY

This project as for goal to help share file between computer on a lan party.
We used to share file with smb  on a computer or on a NAS, when more and more people need to have it.
This method became slow because of the NAS or computer network card end up being saturated.
Here we have a solution to share file between people with a local torrent tracker, no DHT, Pex, or LSD so the internet connexion is not used.
And the computer use to share file still can be used as an httpseed for the initial transfert.

The project is at very early stage of development, it as no security feature implented.
